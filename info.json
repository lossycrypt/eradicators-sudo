  "description"      : "/sudo is a command line helper utilty that aims to make common tasks easier by providing shortcuts to commonly used api features. \n\nIt is a modding, development and administration tool NOT inteded for normal play. Use \"/sudo help\" to get started. I strongly recommended deactivating it once you're done. Prolonged use can cause sloth, desyncs, cheating-addiction and/or desire to write your own mods.",
